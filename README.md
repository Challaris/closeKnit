Founding Vision

Starting Use Case
The vision is to have one place where all Nigerians go to to see who is in the work force, where and what skills they have acquired, and what they are working on. THe information will not just be gathered one time at onboarding but the platform will stay plugged into the professionals day in order to update his profile with minimal manual intervention.

project RoadMap
MileStone One: Imagine LinkedIn but stripped of all the flavors and noise that do not contribute to the vision.
 - First KPI/Goal: Have all Nigerian developers on the same platform
 - Onboarding via code as a barrier to entry?

MileStone Two: Imagine Upwork but focus on core use cases to onboard employers and project owners and connect them to a vast unique database of real time profiles with honest self and community assessment.
- Second KPI/Goal: have all major Nigerian Employers on the same platform
- Make the business of connecting the right talent to the right employer offering their kind of quality life #NOCOST

MileStone Three: Imagine a community that is buzzing and alive with work and workers; funded projects and give back projects equally valued; where all levels of skillsets get matched to their capacity; where criticism spurs growth; where honesty is the down payment that makes the community run.
- Third KPI/Goal: Have all Nigerian professionals use the platform for HR management. Both as a worker and employer. 
- When someone leaves a company, they just switch organizations within the platform
- Imagine how you can switch from one organization to the other in GitHub, but imagine if you can keep stats and valued information about what you did there as a trail that validates your work. 
- Switching companies should feel like going from one slack group to another or one github organization to the other. Your body of work and skills come with you.
